## Overview
  I just created a result-summary website based on the Mentor Frontend challenge. Based on what I just learned, I haven't really mastered skills such as CSS reuse, and responsive web design on multiple mobile device sizes. I need to study and practice more

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
